  //how about adding some text whether number is even or odd
  val myNumberDescriptions = for (n <- squares) yield {
    //i could do some extra stuff here first
    //my last line should be what I want to yield
    if (n % 2 == 0) s"Even square $n"
    else s"Odd square $n" //remember we are returning the last line in our block of { }
  }

  //alternative to yield, even shorter
